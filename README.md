# shuttle-classifiers
Classifiers comparision on shuttle dataset, using Kernel Density and Grid Search CV
This notebook contains classification solutions to the shuttle dataset, which is a highly biased dataset.
The classifiers used are - Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Bayes Decision Rule.
Preprocessing has been done to reach >92% accuracy for each of them.
